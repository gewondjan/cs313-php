TODOS:

1. When I am done building, I will add references to where I got all the pieces as needed!

2. Create the home page with the get header add-in (which puts the style and sheets that are needed for all pages)
    Additionally add the get nav-bar functionality set up with a parameter to highlight which navigation element you are on
    (use bootstrap navigation bar).

    So in three words, complete home.php, header.php and navbar.php

3. Build login and logout functionality with session variables detemine if the session set-up should be in header or no (probably should)

4. build db connection file

5. Ryan you were slightly late to starting the Group team project should you make a change to your grade???



Next:

todo link and page set up to display associated TODOS set up the todo page as well

then make the bucketlist page so that it can handle a change in priority (UI and database will be updated).



Future:

Could add a security check to make sure different users cannot get the todo items of other users.
